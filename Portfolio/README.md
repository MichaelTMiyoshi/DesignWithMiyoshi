# Portfolio
Students who take my class the second year and beyond are required to create portfolios.  These portfolios can be housed on GitHub.  The students should also have physical portfolios of their work.

## Projects
Students get to choose their own projects.  They are also required to do two specific projects.

### *Group project*
Group projects are important for students of any skill level.  After all, projects in the real world are seldom done in isolation.  Students need to be able to work with others.  So they need to do at least one group project.

### *Solve a World Problem project*
It is fun to create.  Period.  However, designers also need to design products for specific purposes.  I still let them choose, but students need to design a product that can help solve a world problem.  One of the biggest problems throughout much of the world is obtaining clean water.  Students who have tackled this problem have looked at and often modified people-powered water drills, water augers, and even personal water purifiers.

Other possible world problems that students might try to tackle with design are:
* Overcrowding (housing solutions, urban design, etc.)
* Homelessness
* other problems that are more than comfort or convenience issues.
