# Portfolio
Students who take my class the second year and beyond are required to create portfolios.  These portfolios can be housed on GitHub.  The students should also have physical portfolios of their work.

Make your repo private.  If you decide later to use it as part of an online portfolio or resume, you can then make it public.  Follow this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9rcfkhii9M&feature=youtu.be) to see how to store your portfolio on GitHub.

My suggestion of how you should organize your repo is to have a few folders under your repo.  In the repo landing should just be your readme.md and your license files.  Then, use the following folders/directories for the different parts of your portfolio:

* Models (and drawings)
* Pictures and Renderings
* Documents
* Reference Material

You could have more than these, but I would say the minimum would be the top three folders.  By the way, if you create this structure in your local repo, you will not see any folders that are empty.  Once you put something in your local folder and then push your commits, you will see the folder and its associated files.  It might freak you out the first time that happens.  Just remember that GitHub does not store empty folders.

## Projects
Students get to choose their own projects.  They are also required to do two specific projects.

### *Group project*
Group projects are important for students of any skill level.  After all, projects in the real world are seldom done in isolation.  Students need to be able to work with others.  So they need to do at least one group project.

### *Solve a World Problem project*
Creating is fun.  Period.  However, designers also need to design products for specific purposes.  I still let them choose, but students need to design a product that can help solve a world problem.  

One of the biggest problems throughout much of the world is obtaining clean water.  Students who have tackled this problem have looked at and often modified people-powered water drills, water augers, and even personal water purifiers.  Students in my class must have my approval on what problems they are going to try and solve with design.

Other possible world problems that students might try to tackle with design are:
* Overcrowding (housing solutions, urban design, etc.)
* Homelessness
* other problems that are more than comfort or convenience issues.
