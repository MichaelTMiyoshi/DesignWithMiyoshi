# Projects

Projects are the heart of any design class.  (As such, they are the majority of the grade as well.)

Projects all have the following requirements:
- Sketch(es) - orthographic sketches are required; perspective view sketches can also be made
- 3D models - 3D models are created in the different software used
- Drawings - orthographic drawings are required for each part; assembly drawings are required for assemblies with multiple parts
- Hand-written descriptions - Descriptions are required to accompany sketches; in the beginning, they must be hand-written in block letters
- A physical model (built or 3D printed) - few projects will not have a physical model
- Written documentation

## Intro Students

Intro students will create required projects

- 3 Simple Shapes (can be simple extrusions with some complex features)
- 3 Shapes that require auxiliary view drawing(s) for at least one face of the shape
- 3 Shapes that require or are at least enhanced by section view drawing(s)
- Birdhouse part and assembly project
- Semester [group project](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/Projects/IntroDesignProject/pr_2023RollingToy.docx) to solve a specific problem (1st semester) - Files associated with this project are in [this folder](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/tree/master/Projects/IntroDesignProject) and downloadable as Word files.
- 2 Revit building projects (one can be a tutorial)
- Projects that the students choose.  (Students may choose to use Solidworks, Revit, or Blender for their projects.  Note that Blender is not taught in class.)

## Advanced Students

Advanced students may choose their projects and the software that they use to make their projects.  Solidworks, Revit, and Blender are software packages that advanced students may use.  Other software may be used if approved by the instructor.  (Note: Blender is not taught in class even though it is approved for use on projects.)

Advanced students are required to design a project to solve (or help solve) a world problem and a group project.  The world problem solution design may be done as a group project, but it is not required to be.
