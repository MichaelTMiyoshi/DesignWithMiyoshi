# Projects

Projects are the heart of any design class.  As such, they are the majority of the grade as well.

Projects all have the following requirements:
- Sketch(es) - orthographic sketches are required; perspective view sketches can also be made
- 3D models - 3D models are created in the different software used
- Drawings - orthographic drawings are required for each part; assembly drawings are required for assemblies with multiple parts
- Hand-written descriptions - Descriptions are required to accompany sketches; in the beginning, they must be hand-written in block letters
- A physical model (built or 3D printed) - few projects will not have a physical model
- Written documentation
