Rubrics for the beginning student projects are located in this folder.  They are Microsoft Excel files and must be downloaded, filled in, and printed with the projects.

Note that the rubric is for each set of projects.  If a student only does one of the projects (in a section), he or she can still do the other projects.  Just turn in what you have with the rubric.  Then, add more projects to the pack of projects of the same type.
