Architectural &amp; Engineering Design

This is the companion repo for my Architectural & Engineering Design I class.  You will find the problems that you will be doing and the directions on how to keep them together.

The main form for turning in assignments is what I call Goal Sheets.  Goal sheets are collections of problems that you will be doing.  These collections are sets of two weeks of problems and cover specific skills.
