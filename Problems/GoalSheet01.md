# Goal Sheet 01

**Lettering**

You are going to think this is a waste of paper, but you are going to write block letters.  You will make four pages with five lines of lettering.  You may write school appropriate things on those lines or you can just write the alphabet and digits over and over and over.  Follow the requirements below:

Requirements:

* Start with unlined printer paper oriented landscape (long side up).
* Use a pencil to make your letters.
* Letters must be between 1/8" and 3/16" tall.  That is small.
* You must have a 1" margin around all the sides where there is to be no lettering.  You do not need to make lines to show the margins (but light lines are helpful.)
* Letter your name in the lower right hand corner (inside the margins).  First initial.  Last name.  Use all capital letters.

The grading for my students for this assignment follow these criteria:

* Letters and digits are neat.
* Letters are all caps.
* Letters and digits are all between 1/8" and 3/16" tall.
* Letters and digits follow the proper proportions and line sequence (or at least appear to).
* Letters and digits are all inside the margins.
* Name is lettered properly and is inside the margins.
* Only one side of the paper is used.  (If you mess up, you may use the other side.)

**Sketching**

You are going to sketch 4 different objects.  You will make the orthographic views necessary to fully describe the object.

The grading for my students for this assignment follow these criteria:

* Sketch is proportional to the original figure.
* Sketch has the appropriate views necessary to create the object.
* Sketch views are lined up in their appropriate locations on the paper.
* Proper technique to line up the views is evident (you can keep the construction lines you use).
* Sketch views are all inside the margins.
* Name is lettered properly and is inside the margins.
* Only one side of the paper is used.  (If you mess up, you may use the other side.)

You will end up with four sheets of paper in this goal sheet.
