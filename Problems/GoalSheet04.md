# Goal Sheet 04

Section views.  It might not make complete sense, but full section views are when you look at a model as if you cut it in half.  A half section view looks at the model as if you cut a quarter out of it (and looked at the three-quarters that are left).

Note: In my classroom, I use these drawings as a way for the students to learn how to use calipers.  That is the reason that the drawings do not have dimensions.  Those modeling the drawings will need to print the drawings and then use some sort of measuring device to determine the necessary dimensions.  Remember to not just measure, but look at the scale to see how big the object really is.  Hidden lines are not used in section views.

**9-49A (Half-Section)**

Use SolidWorks to create the model and then the drawing for <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/9-49A.pdf">Figure 9-49A</a>.  For a challenge, try printing out the drawing with no dimensions <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/9-49ANoDims.pdf">Figure 9-49ANoDims</a> and using calipers or another measuring device to figure out the dimensions.  Take care to note the scale of the drawing if you take this challenge.

The grading for my students for all the models and drawings in this assignment follow these criteria:

* Model is perfect (size and shape).
* Model is made full scale.
* Drawing uses ANSI drafting standards.
* Drawing has all necessary and appropriate views.
* Drawing has proper auxiliary view with hidden lines visible.
* Drawing has proper and appropriate section view.  Hidden lines are not shown in section views.
* Drawing has all necessary and appropriate dimensions.
* Drawing is neat.
* Drawing tangent edges are turned off in orthographic and auxiliary views (may be on in perspective views).
* Drawing title block is filled in properly (name, date, design group title, drawing title).

**9-49B (Half-Section)**

Use SolidWorks to create the model and then the drawing for <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/9-49B.pdf">Figure 9-49B</a>.

**9-49F (Half-Section)**

Use SolidWorks to create the model and then the drawing for <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/9-49F.pdf">Figure 9-49F</a>.

**9-49J (Half-Section)**

Use SolidWorks to create the model and then the drawing for <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/9-49J.pdf">Figure 9-49J</a>.

**9-50A (Full-Section)**

Use SolidWorks to create the model and then the drawing for <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/9-50A.pdf">Figure 9-50A</a>.

**9-50C (Full-Section)**

Use SolidWorks to create the model and then the drawing for <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/9-50C.pdf">Figure 9-50C</a>.

**9-50K (Full-Section aligned)**

Use SolidWorks to create the model and then the drawing for <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/9-50K.pdf">Figure 9-50K</a>.

* Make sure that the full-section of this drawing is aligned.  That is, make sure that the section goes through two adjacent "spokes" of the figure.

**9-50L (Full-Section)**

Use SolidWorks to create the model and then the drawing for <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/9-50L.pdf">Figure 9-50L</a>.
