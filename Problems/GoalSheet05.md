# Goal Sheet 05

Toy Semi Truck.  You will be creating parts for a toy semi truck.  This toy would be created using wood.  It is not very artistic at this point, but may be at a later date.  This goal sheet is not quite ready for prime time (10/22/2020), but there are drawings for several of the parts.

The grading for my students for all the models and drawings in this assignment follow these criteria:

* Model is perfect (size and shape).
* Model is made full scale.
* Drawing uses ANSI drafting standards.
* Drawing has all necessary and appropriate views.
* Drawing has proper auxiliary view with hidden lines visible (if needed).
* Drawing has proper and appropriate section view (if needed).  Hidden lines are not shown in section views.
* Drawing has proper and appropriate detail view(s) (if needed).
* Drawing has all necessary and appropriate dimensions.
* Drawing is neat.  (Beautiful even.)
* Drawing tangent edges are turned off in orthographic and auxiliary views (may be on in perspective views).
* Drawing title block is filled in properly (name, date, design group title, drawing title).

There are other models and drawings that will be made and graded according to the following criteria:

* Assembly has appropriate parts and mates
* Assembly drawing is created
* Exploded view drawing is created
* Drawing title block is filled in properly (name, date, design group title, drawing title).
