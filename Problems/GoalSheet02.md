# Goal Sheet 02

You will be creating a couple simple objects, a few complex objects, and at least two objects for your design project.  The first two (5-37 and 5-38) are worth half the points as the others.  You may choose to do 5-42 or 5-43.  The last two figures (5-46E and 5-46L) are required.  To finish out the goal sheet, you will create at least 2 of the objects you sketched for your project.  If you have changed your idea, you may create the new parts instead.

**5-37**

Use SolidWorks to create the model and then the drawing for <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/blob/master/images/5-37.pdf">Figure 5-37</a>.

The grading for my students for all the models and drawings in this assignment follow these criteria:

* Model is perfect (size and shape).
* Model is made full scale.
* Drawing uses ANSI drafting standards.
* Drawing has all necessary and appropriate views.
* Drawing has all necessary and appropriate dimensions.
* Drawing is neat.
* Drawing tangent edges are turned off in orthographic views (may be on in perspective views).
* Drawing title block is filled in properly (name, date, design group title, drawing title).
