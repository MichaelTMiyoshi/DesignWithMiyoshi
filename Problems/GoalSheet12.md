# Goal Sheet 12 (and beyond)

The Advanced Goal Sheet is simply a tool I use for my advanced students to tell me what progress they are making toward finishing their projects.  They turn in the goal sheets every two weeks like they do as beginning students, but they need to make sure they do so on time.  The students merely tell me what they have done the two weeks they are reporting on and what they plan to do the next two weeks.  This should provide a continuity check, but there are certainly times when students do not do exactly what they thought they were going to do.  This is a good life lesson because we all have goals that get sidetracked by other important things.

My advanced students choose what software they will use to make their projects.  My beginning students get that choice after they finish Goal Sheet 11.  I give them a choice of two pieces of software that we use in class together and that I give them some instructions on (SolidWorks and Revit) and one piece of software that I do not teach (Blender).  If students want to use other pieces of software, we have a discussion about it and I decide to let them or not.  Students may also choose to go back and forth between the different pieces of software.

Projects range from simple projects to complex projects.  It is really up to the students.  And they create some fantastic things.
