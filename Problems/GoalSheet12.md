# Goal Sheet 12 (and beyond)

The Advanced Goal Sheet is simply a tool I use for my advanced students to tell me what progress they are making toward finishing their projects.

The students make choose what software to use.  I give them a choice of two pieces of software that we use in class together and that I give them some instructions on (SolidWorks and Revit) and one piece of software that I do not teach (Blender).  If students want to use other pieces of software, we have a discussion about it and I decide to let them or not.

Projects range from simple projects to complex projects.  It is really up to the students.  And they create some fantastic things.
