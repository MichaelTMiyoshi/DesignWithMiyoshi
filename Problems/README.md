# Problems
These problem statements in this folder are the ones I use in my class.  I group them into what I call goal sheets (which are how they are named in the files here).  Each goal sheet is slated to take two weeks.

As I said, I will have the problems in files representing those two week goal sheets.  By the way, if you count the number of goal sheets and know that a typical high school calendar has 18 weeks per semester, you will wonder why not all goal sheets have problems.  That is because I have catch up goal sheets in my class.  (Sorry, no mustard ones, but one of my former students said that everybody ought to relish every goal sheet.)  Which is also why they are not numbered sequentially.  (Or maybe why I will put the catch up goal sheets in the sequence.)

## Philosophy
I need to give a little statement of philosophy for those of you who might be educators looking at this repo.

**I believe that anybody can learn given enough time.**  The unfortunate thing about teaching in a school (high school in my case) is that there are time restrictions.  As a result, students need to be to a certain point in the course of study at the end of each semester.  And they are given grades based on their skill level attained, quality and quantity of work, and other criteria (leadership, in my case).

I tend to teach at a fairly quick pace.  I intoduce new concepts quickly out of the gate.  And then, a new concept about every two weeks.  The thing is that not everybody can keep up with that pace.  Which is to be expected.  There will also be those students for whom the pace will be too slow.  Which is also to be expected.  That is why I have what I call goal sheets.

Every two weeks students give me their drawings (of the models they create from the drawings I assign them) in a packet called a goal sheet.  At least that is the aim.  I actually want them to give me each drawing as they finish it so I can grade it and give them feedback right away.  Then, they can collect the programs for the goal sheet and staple them to a goal sheet form.  I then add up the scores, do a conversion, and put the grades in the gradebook.

This process works great.  Especially for those students who want to go faster than the average bear.  They know all of the assignments for the semester (and year) as soon as they logon to the system, so they can go full speed ahead.  Usually, without me as much more than a guide and a corrector of goal sheets.

But what about those students who are slower than the average bear?  I am glad you asked.  Those students are afforded the chance to catch up with the rest.  Indeed, all of the students are afforded a chance to catch up.  I actually call these catch up goal sheets.  I have a couple in the first semester.  That might seem like a lot, but it is about right.

So why have the catch up goal sheets at all if I know the pace the students need to go?  Another good question.  I do that because it gives the students a clear delineation point where they can stop and take a breath.  They know that I am not just going to leave everybody behind.  They know I want them to succeed.  These catch up goal sheets are tangible evidence of that.  The faster than the average bear students see them in a different light.  They just see them as a way to get further ahead.

### Notes
* The Advanced Goal Sheet is simply a tool I use when the students are done with the required models and drawings.  The students are making their own creations at that point.

* I already mentioned it, but my students have access to all the goal sheets from the time they first logon to the system.  And once I am done with this repo, everybody will have access to those goal sheets.  At least the problems in them.

* I use many problems from an old books.  *Mechanical Drawing* (ninth edition) by French, Svensen, Helsel, and Urbanick.  *Architectura: Drafting and Design* (fourth edition) by Hepler and Wallach.  I do not believe that sharing drawings that I made from these book infringes upon their copyright, but I could be mistaken.  So I would welcome thoughts and corrections on this matter.
