This folder holds documents useful for students in my classes as well as for those just looking around.

Note: Copyrights of renderings, drawings, and documents done by my former students are held by those individuals.

The GoalSheetAdvanced.doc document is for my beginning students.  To use the document, you fill out your work ethic for each day of the two week period.  Then, fill in the boxes of what you did during the last two weeks and what you are planning to do the next two weeks.  Follow the directions in the document, and you will be fine.
