# Goal Sheets

This folder contains the printable goal sheets for class use.  Just download them and print them.

Note:  Three of the goal sheets (5, 6, 7) are different in class than they are here on GitHub.  That was due to the pandemic and not having access to a tutorial book.  I have given students a choice for these three goal sheet, but that may change in the future.
