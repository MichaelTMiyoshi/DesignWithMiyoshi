# Goal Sheets

This folder contains the printable goal sheets for class use.  Just download them and print them.

Note:  Three of the goal sheets (5, 6, 7) are different in class than they are here on the GitHub pages.  That was due to the pandemic and not having access to a tutorial book.  I have given students a choice for these three goal sheet, but that may change in the future.  I prefer students use the goal sheets in this folder and the models and drawing from the printable word documents than those from the digital ones here on GitHub.
